This repo contains the code used in Enerkey Hackathon 2019 and the website that was the result. 

The scipts are written using a gnu/linux env and they have not been tested using other enviroments other than the my. 
In addition to normal commands they require R to be installed.

Full execution is to run kaikki.bash from src (PWD must be there) and as a parameter give the folder containing the zip file from OneDrive. The script will run other scipts and the result will be in folder valmis.

The file tree shows the resulting structure.

If you un the scripts one by one manually set the enviroment variable SCRIPTIT to the folder containing these scripts.

To view the website simply open the index.html in a browser.
